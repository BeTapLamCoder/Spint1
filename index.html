            <h3>Use Meaningful Names</h3>
            <p>When naming variables, functions, and classes, pick names that clearly describe their purpose. Instead of calling a variable <code>b</code>, try <code>numberOfUsers</code>. This way, anyone reading your code can easily understand its purpose without needing additional comments. A meaningful name eliminates guesswork and avoids confusion.</p>

            <h3>Follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</h3>
            <p>The Single Responsibility Principle means that each function or method should have one specific job.

                This keeps your functions short and focused which makes them easier to read, test, and maintain.
                
                Imagine a toolbox where each tool has a unique purpose—clean code functions should work the same way.
                For instance, if you have a function called calculateTotal, it should only handle calculating the total. If you add extra tasks, it can lead to confusing code that’s hard to maintain.

Here's an example to show why it's important to keep functions focused:

Let’s say you want to calculate a total and return an object with extra information, like who calculated it and when. Instead of adding these directly into calculateTotal, we can use a second function.

            <h3>Avoid Unnecessary Comments</h3>
            <p>Good code should be self-explanatory without needing excessive comments. Focus on writing code that’s clear and understandable on its own.

                Comments are helpful when explaining complex logic or a unique approach, but too many comments can clutter your code and make it hard to follow.</p>

            <h3>Make Your Code Readable</h3>
            <p>Readable code uses indentation, line breaks, and spaces to keep everything neat and organized.

                Think of it like writing a story: paragraphs make reading easier by breaking up large chunks of text. In coding, line breaks serve the same purpose.</p>

        <section class="details">
            <h3>Write Unit Tests</h3>
            <p>Unit tests help make sure each part of your code works as expected.

                By testing small, individual parts (like functions), you can catch bugs early and prevent them from spreading to other parts of the code.
                
                Concretely, unit tests are actually mini quality checks for each part of your code to ensure they’re working as intended.</p>
